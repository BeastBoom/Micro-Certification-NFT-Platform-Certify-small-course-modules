# Micro-Certification NFT Platform

## Project Title
**Micro-Certification NFT Platform** - Certify Small Course Modules

## Project Description
The Micro-Certification NFT Platform is a blockchain-based solution built on the Aptos network that enables educational institutions, online course providers, and independent instructors to issue verifiable digital certifications for small course modules and micro-learning sessions. Each certification is stored as a unique digital asset on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity, immutability, and easy verification.

This smart contract provides a decentralized approach to micro-credentialing, allowing learners to accumulate verified skills and knowledge from various sources while maintaining complete ownership and portability of their certifications.
